# Mongo and Mongoose

MongoDB is a database that stores data records (documents) for use by an application. Mongo is a non-relational, "NoSQL" database. This means Mongo stores all data associated with an entry in one document, instead of storing it across multiple preset tables based on the type of information being stored (as in a SQL-style database). Some benefits of this storage model are:
- Scalability
- Dynamic
- Replication

While there are many "NoSQL" databases in the market, the similarities between Mongo's BSON document storage structure and JSON make it natural choice when learning backend Javascript.

Mongoose.js is an npm module for Node.js that allows you to write object models for Mongo as you would in Javascript.
