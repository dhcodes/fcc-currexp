# React

React is a javascript library designed to make it easier to build complex user interfaces. React does this in a few ways:

1. React allows HTML to render from a Javascript file.

2. React breaks a website's parts into Components that can then be combined to build pages.

3. React Components can pass data to each other as properties

React uses a virtual Document Object Model. Instead of changing the DOM directly, React makes a simplified copy of the DOM (the virtual DOM) when the page loads. This allows React to make changes to elements on the page without re-rendering the entire page. This can improve the responsiveness and functionality of single-page applications.

While not part of the React library and not required, JSX is often paired with React. JSX is a preprocessor for Javascript written in a syntax akin to XML that results in more readable code.

React is an open-source library, maintained by Facebook and shared under a [BSD License](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/LICENSE).

**Fun fact:** freeCodeCamp is built using React.
