# Node Modules with npm

The Node Package Manager (npm) is a command-line tool that provides a way for developers to share and control modules (or packages) of Javascript code written for use with Node.js. These packages can save time When initialized, npm generates a <code>package.json</code> file that lists the package dependencies for your project. Since these npm packages are constantly updated, the <code>package.json</code> file allows you to set specific version numbers for each dependency to ensure that changes to the dependency don't break your project.
