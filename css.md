#CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to manipulate:
+colors
+fonts
+positioning
+spacing
+sizing
+decorations
+transitions

CSS can be applied both as inline styles--typed directly within your HTML tags--or external style sheets--typed in a separate file that is referenced and applied from a separate file. The latter is the preferred method as it keeps the styles separate from the HTML, therefore improving the readability and reusability of your code.

In this section, you'll see how adding CSS styles to the text of your CatPhotoApp can change its appearance
